   It is important to understand your audience so as to describe your project in a niche language that is both easy to understand by the same audience and more appealing to them so as to attract their attention and interest to your project. 
   I can tailor my pitch in a design that is both relatable and of interest to different audiences eg when prsenting to investors ill describe the problem or inadequacy of the product and explain how large the arget market is approximately thus intriguing them. While if i did explain the same to customers i'd describe the products, giving its best features and distinctions from the rest that may be familiar to mine, i would also create different versions of the product to create a diversity and show potential customization to fit every customers needs

2. Problem Statement:
   - Describe the importance of a clear problem statement in a software project pitch. How do you effectively communicate the problem your software aims to solve?
   It allows one to explain the problem in a sort of layman's language that almost all demographics of people can understands especially people who do not work in tech or are not software engineers

5. Unique Selling Proposition (USP):
   - Explain the concept of a Unique Selling Proposition (USP). How do you identify and articulate your software project's USP in your pitch?
    Unique Selling Proposition is the essence of what makes your product or service better than competitors
    I articulate my projects USP by naming features that exist in it but do not exist in any competitor products. I would also speak affordabale yet profitable prices that would encourage both customers and investors. I would also speak on the different versions of the products that satisfy different demographics of people  bent on their preferences

6. Technical Feasibility:

   The details I would include for my projects technical viability would include:
                           -I would describe the team size and work rates
                           -I would give a favourable deadline for the launch of the project
                           -I would describe the progress already made so far

                                          -messaging must be there and be well articulated such that it attracts the target market
